The VectorDisc icon-set for [NSIS][1], as the name suggest, is a reduced representation of an optical disc, clearly labeled with the words "Setup" and "Remove" to reveal their purpose. The download includes two icons in various sizes (16✕16, 32✕32, 48✕48, 128✕128), two wizard images, and the original vector file in SVG format.
